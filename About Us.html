   	</p>
   	
   	<p style="font-size: 20px;line-height: 2;">
   		Recipe of Traditional Food was founded in 2000 by Elaine as a home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes. Today, Recipe of Traditional Food has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than 3,000 tested recipes, guides, and meal plans, drawing over 15 million readers each month from around the world. We’re supported by a diverse group of recipe developers, food writers, recipe and product testers, photographers, and other creative professionals

   		Our History
   	</p>

   	<p style="font-size: 20px;line-height: 2;">
   		Elaine was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away in 1998. In 2000, Eliane moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Recipe of Traditional Food . Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, Recipe of Traditional Food was acquired by Dotdash Meredith, a New York-based media company.

    	Recipe Development & Testing
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px;line-height: 2;">
        Our recipes primarily use fresh, unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned, frozen, and other prepared ingredients. We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods: real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables, and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese. Plus cake for dessert.<br><br>

        There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Recipe of Traditional Food :<br><br>

        <b>First, does it work?</b> Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results, every time.<br><br>

        <b>Second, is it delicious? </b>Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves? <br><br>

        <b>Third, is it worth the effort? </b>Do we want to make it again (and again and again)?<br><br>

        To make sure each of these standards is met, we start by working with expert recipe developers  — people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop a good recipe in their own kitchens, but to make sure that recipe works in yours. Next, we thoroughly review and edit every recipe in-house line by line. Finally, each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots, pans, and tools that you use in yours. Only after all this is the recipe shared on Recipe of Traditional Food .
